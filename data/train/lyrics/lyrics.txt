Gently hold our hands Gently hold our heads on high  Aimless time in fear new hide Overthrow the plan Confusion lies in all my words Mad is the soul  We barricade ourselves in holes of temperament This is the dawning of a new age A heart that beats the wrong way Insanity's crescendo  Windcolour, second sight A touch of silence and the violence of dark Illusion span, the aroma of time Shadowlife and the scent of nothingness  Infinite fall of instinct Order of one spells deceit Infin
We are the Sun We are the dead stars We are the black sky Invading your room We are the candle The only light We are the machines of the past Forever victims and murderers of your joy  We are Death The ancient knowledge The source of origin The red and white sacred hatred Enthroned, materialized The wrath of heaven and hell united in one Worship us, be faithful Beautiful great and cursed  Vexilla regis prodeunt, fulget crucis mysterium Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni  We are the... Mother of suffering Bringer of virtue
You're out of touch I'm out of time But I'm out of my head when you're not around You're out of touch I'm out of time But I'm out of my head when you're not around  You're out of touch You're out of touch You're out of touch You're out of touch You're out of touch...  You're out of touch I'm out of time But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You finally close the door You've left open wide Lock it from the inside You lay me down and count me out  Watch out, it's all on you There's worse ways to see it, baby Set fire and watch it burning Come here, sit next me
Lullaby by birdland that's what I Always hear, when you sigh, Never in my wordland could there be words to reveal In a phrase how I feel  Have you ever heard two turtle doves Bill and coo, when they love? That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips When we kiss  And there's a weepy old willow He really knows how to cry
It's the wood man and his splintering self. It's the wooden woman and her hollowing out  Sickly Micky Mouse. Skinny Minnie Mouse.  Elvis, what happened?  Pop Sickle note: The lable stapled a speaker To the back of a sheep's throat. Tongue depressor with the width
Dying men keep rifles in cello cases, Known with a beer as the deer eraser. They dress their boys in bright orange And leave their daughters at home, Stripping meat, stretching skin for their musical men.  The makers of guns will never go hungry. The makers of guns will never fill up. May their children always play murder weapon since stick. 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  There lived a certain man, in Russia long ago He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow Most people looked at him with terror and with fear But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear  He could preach the Bible like a preacher Full of ecstasy and fire But he also was the kind of teacher Women would desire  Ra-ra, Rasputin Lover of the Russian queen There was a cat that really was gone Ra ra Rasputin
Oooh oooh Hmmmmh  It's been the longest winter without you I didn't know where to turn to See somehow I can't forget you After all that we've been through  Going coming thought I heard a knock Who's there no one Thinking that I deserve it Now I realize that I really didn't know  If you didn't notice you mean everything Quickly I'm learning to love again All I know is Imma be OK  Thought I couldn't live without you It's gonna hurt when it heals too (Oh yeah) It'll all get better in time
There's nothing I could say to you Nothing I could ever do to make you see What you mean to me All the pain the tears I cried Still you never said goodbye And now I know How far you'd go  I know I let you down But it's not like that now This time I'll never Let you go  I will be All that you want And get myself together 'Cause you keep me from falling apart All my life I'll be with you forever To get you through the day And make everything OK  I thought that I had everything I didn't know what life could bring
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh But somethin' happened for the very first time with you My heart melted to the ground Found somethin' true And everyone's looking 'round thinking I'm going crazy, ooh I But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep, keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love You cut me open Uuh ooh Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
How do I breathe, yeah? How do I breathe, yeah?  It feels so different being here I was so used to being next to you Life for me is not the same There's no one to turn to I don't know why I let it go too far Starting over - it's so hard Seems like everywhere I try to go I keep thinking of you  I just had a wake up call (Call) Wishing that I never let you fall (Fall) Baby you are not to blame at all When I'm the one that pushed you away Baby if you knew I cared (Cared) You'd have never went nowhere (Nowhere) Girl I should've been right there  How do I breathe Without you here by my side? How will I see When your love brought me to the light? Where do I go When your heart's where I lay my head? When you're not with me How do I breathe?
If I could crawl into a shell Then I would a mile away Things are heavy enough already And I really do think that's The best that I can do Stuck here and all And I really do think that Don't care at all  Take a step forwards Don't be afraid Take a step backwards Don't be afraid So go on So look back Stuck inside a heavy shell Try to walk and not be pushed  And the man with no skin I would not let him Would not let him sign off 'Cause nobody wants to see A beating heart
I will never see the sun Spadina, St. George, Bay, and Yonge One for nothing, all for one Spadina, St. George, Bay and Yonge  Hey you look like royalty Weren't you born with muddy feet? Hoarse, in high tops, totally lost Those two streets will never meet  I will never see the sun
O hold me O holy O golden O grace Down here in fear, down where none can hear Any whisper, any word  Don't wanna, you wanna Don't wanna, you wanna Don't wanna, you wanna Don't wanna, you wanna Don't wanna, you wanna No sudden moves  Don't wanna, you wanna Don't wanna, you wanna Don't wanna, you wanna Don't wanna, you wanna
Breathing this poison, alive but near death Under the water, and holding my breath But we were made to drink in the earth Its river and gutters, its mountains of worth  Fur and feathers, and leather, and scales
It's only human to wonder why It's only animal to do it It's only animal to run along the rocks And move along instead of talk It's only human to wonder how And how I wish I could talk to you now  And the words tumble out of your mouth Like apples from a wild tree And mine they spy out cautiously Like a creature from its cave
We feel the anger rise before the wake We march against the wars of hate The wratful demons come to brake your fate You're living in a lie, you won't be safe My heart is burned to six feet under My soul is black as the moonless night There's one thing that the heathens seek The fragile flesh of the unborn child  Why won't you listen to me? Just listen to me Why can't you hear the screams? The screams so loud That all the salt of the tears that they all will cry
Load up on guns and bring your friends. It's fun to lose and to pretend. She's overbored and self assured. Oh no, I know a dirty word.  Hello, hello, hello, how low? Hello, hello, hello, how low? Hello, hello, hello, how low? Hello, hello, hello.  With the lights out it's dang'rous. Here we are now, entertain us. I feel stupid and contagious. Here we are now, entertain us. A mullato, an albino, a mosquito, my libido. Yay, yay, yay, 
Tomorrow I'll say happy birthday darling And surprise you with a gift when I come home Then mine forgetful arms will reach out for you I can't forget you just because you're gone
If it sounds country man That's what it is It's a country song, yeah, okay One, two, three, four One, two, three, four  Busted flat in Baton Rouge, and headin' for the trains Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained Took us all away to New Orleans  I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues With them windshield wipers slappin' time And Bobby clappin' hands, we finally sang up
Well, I woke up Sunday morning With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad So I had one more for dessert  Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes And found my cleanest dirty shirt And I shaved my face and combed my hair And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day  I'd smoked my brain the night before on Cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin' But I lit my first and watched a small kid Cussin' at a can that he was kicking  Then I crossed the empty street
I said, Hello I think I'm broken. And though I was only jokin' It took me by surprise when you agreed. I was tryin to be clever But for the life of me I never Would have guessed how far the simple truth would lead. You knew all my lines. You knew all my tricks. You knew how to heal that pain no medicine can fix.  And I bless the day I met you. And I thank God that he let you Lay beside me for a moment that lives on. And the good news is I'm better for the time we spent together.
Love and other moments are just chemical reactions in your brain In your brain And feelings of aggression are the absence of the love drug In your veins In your veins  Love, come quickly 'Cause I feel myself esteem is cavin' in It's on the brink  Love, come quickly 'Cause I don't think, I can keep this monster in It's in my skin  Pah pah Pah pah  Love and other socially acceptable emotions are morphine They're morphine Cleverly concealin' primal urges often felt but rarely seen Rarely seen
Cold and frosty morning There's not a lot to say About the things caught in my mind And as the day was dawning My plane flew away With all the things caught in my mind  I don't wanna be there when you're coming down I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground  So don't go away Say what you say Say that you'll stay Forever and a day In the time of my life 'Cause I need more time Yes, I need more time Just to make things right  Damn my situation And the games I have to play With all the things caught in my mind
I never thought I'd change my opinion again But you moved me in a way  That I've never known But you moved me in a way  That I've never known  But straight away You just moved into position again  You abused me in a way That I've never known  You abused me in a way That I've never known So break me, shake me  Hate me, take me over When the madness stops Then you will be alone  Just break me, shake me  Hate me, take me over When the madness stops
Maybe it's intuition But somethings you just don't question Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend  I know that it might sound more than a little crazy, but I believe  I knew I loved you before I met you I think I dreamed you into life I knew I loved you before I met you I have been waiting all my life  There's just no rhyme or reason Only a sense of completion And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces
When you feel all alone And the world has turned its back on you Give me a moment please To tame your wild, wild heart  I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you It's hard to find relief And people can be so cold  When darkness is upon your door And you feel like you can't take anymore  Let me be the one you call If you jump I'll break your fall Lift you up and fly away with you into the night If you need to fall apart I can mend a broken heart If you need to crash then crash and burn, you're not alone  When you feel all alone And a loyal friend is hard to find You're caught in a one-way street With the monsters in your head When hopes and dreams are far away And you feel like you can't face the day
When superstars and cannonballs are running through your head A television freak show cops and robbers everywhere Subway makes me nervous, people pushing me too far I've got to break away So take my hand now  'Cause I want to live like animals Careless and free like animals I want to live I want to run through the jungle The wind in my hair and the sand at my feet  I've been having difficulties keeping to myself Feelings and emotions better left up on the shelf Animals and children tell the truth, they never lie Which one is more human There's a thought, now you decide  Compassion in the jungle Compassion in your hands, yeah Would you like to make a run for it Would you like to take my hand, yeah  'Cause I want to live like animals Careless and free like animals I want to live I want to run through the jungle The wind in my hair and the sand at my feet
And she takes another step Slowly she opens the door Check that he is sleeping Pick up all the broken glass And furniture on the floor Been up half the night screaming Now it's time to get away Pack up the kids in the car  Another bruise to try and hide Another alibi to write Another ditch in the road You keep moving Another stop sign You keep moving on And the years go by so fast 
I ride this train In the windswept afternoon And the sunlight warms the faces Of the faithless who are waiting I ride this train But I need a conversation Mozambique or was it veronique? How about you pick the subject And I'll listen to you?  People tell me that I feel too much But I don't care, I don't care People tell me that I need too much But I don't care, no I don't care  I ride this train  In a dream-like state of mind
You are a moonchild and pretty soon child I've got that feeling That I'm gonna make you smile forever If I can. Just give me a sign and I'll show you my plan You are a blue child, forever true child You know I'll try to paint the skies blue forever

Stand, in the end, you'll still be you One that's done all the things you set out to do Stand, there's a cross for you to bear Things to go through if you're goin' anywhere  Stand for the things you know are right It's the truth that the truth makes them so uptight Stand, all the things you want are real You have you to complete and there is no deal  Stand, stand, stand (Everybody, yeah) Stand, stand, stand 
Pretty, pretty, pretty as a picture Witty, witty, witty as you can be Blind 'cause your eyes see only glitter Closed to the things that make you free Ever stop to think about a downfall? Happens at the end of every line Just when you think you've pulled a fast one Happens to the foolish all the time  Somebody's watching you Somebody's watching you Somebody's watching you Somebody's watching you  Games are to be played with toys, et cetera Love is to be made when you're for real
Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong My own beliefs are in my song The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then Makes no difference what group I'm in I am everyday people, yeah yeah  There is a blue one who can't accept The green one for living with A fat one tryin' to be a skinny one Different strokes for different folks And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby  Ooh sha sha We got to live together

And girl you're just way too fine Gotta be treated as one of a kind Girl use your mind Don't be just another dime  Because I can't take Seeing you with him 'Cause I know exactly what you'll be In his gallery Just not fair And it's tearing me apart You're just another priceless work of art In his gallery
I spend the days with my vanity I'm lost in heaven and I'm lost to earth Didn't give you minutes not even moments All my life in a tower of foil Shaded feelings, don't believe you When you were there before my eyes No one planned it took it for granted
My love and I, we work well together But often we're apart Absence makes the heart lose wager 'Til love breaks down, love breaks down  Oh my, oh my, have you seen the weather? The sweet September rain Rain on me like no other Until I drown, until I drown  When love breaks down The things you do To stop the truth from hurting you When love breaks down The lies we tell
I'll always think of you Inside of my private thoughts I can imagine you Touching my private parts And just the thought of you I can't help but touch myself That's why I want you so bad  Just one night of Moonlight, with you there beside me All night, doin' it again and again You know, I want you so bad Baby, baby, baby, baby  Ohh, I get so high When I'm around you, baby I can touch the sky You make my temperature rise Baby, you're makin' me high Baby, baby, baby, baby

Please understand, if love ends Then I promise you, I promise you  That, that I shall never breathe again Breathe again  That I shall never breathe again And I can't stop thinkin' about About the way things used to be And I can't stop thinkin' about  About the love that you make to me And I can't get you out of my head How in the world will I begin To let you walk right out my life And blow my heart away And I can't stop carin' about  About the apple of my eye And I can't stop doin' without

Qui dove il mare luccica E tira forte il vento Sulla vecchia terrazza Davanti al golfo di Surriento Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza Dopo che aveva pianto Poi si schiarisce la voce E ricomincia il canto  Te vojo bene assai Ma tanto tanto bene sai E' una catena ormai Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai  Vide le luci in mezzo al mare Penso alle notti la in America Ma erano solo le lampare E la bianca scia di un'elica Senti il dolore nella musica E si alzo dal pianoforte Ma quando vide uscire La luna da una nuvola Gli sembro piu dolce anche la morte Guardo negli occhi la ragazza Quegli occhi verdi come il mare Poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima E lui credette di affogare  Potenza della lirica Dove ogni dramma e un falso Che con un po'di trucco e con la mimica Puoi diventare un altro Ma due occhi che ti quardano Cosi vicini e veri Ti fan scordare le parole Confondono i pensierei Cos diventa tutto piccolo
I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw I'm in the prime of my life Let's make some music, make some money Find some models for wives I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin And fuck with the stars You man, the island and the cocaine And the elegant cars  This is our decision, to live fast and die young We've got the vision Now let's have some fun! Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do? Get jobs in offices? And wake up for the morning commute?  Forget about our mothers and our friends
This is a call to arms To live and love and sleep together We could flood the streets With love or light or heat, whatever Lock the parents out Cut a rug, twist and shout Wave your hands, make it rain The stars will rise again  The youth are starting to change; are you Starting to change, are you? Together, together, together, together Together, together, together The youth are starting to change; are you Starting to change, are you? Together, together, together, together Together, together, together 
All along the Western front People line up to receive She got the power in her hand To shock you like you won't believe Saw her in the Amazon With the voltage running through her skin Standing there, with nothing on She gonna teach me how to swim  I said, "Ooh, girl!" "Shock me like an electric eel" "Baby girl" "Turn me on with your electric feel"  I said, "Ooh, girl!" "Shock me like an electric eel"
I feel your racing heart My liquid silver arms extended These waves aren't far apart Black gold in claw foot tubs unchanging I am fire, where's my form? Whisper crimson I intrude There's light beneath your eyes New overtones in view Endless form, endless time  If what they say is true
I just shook the handshake I just sealed the deal I'll try not to let them Take everything they can steal People always told me Don't forget your roots I know I can feel them underneath my leather boots  You toss all the mornings lost to the clouds and you watch it go Your fair weather friends on a parachute binge get lost when the wind blows The handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongue It tastes like death, but it looks like fun  I was a loner I was just waiting by myself When you, warped temptress Rose to bring me happiness and wealth Black tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoes
And there were future reflections On the face and the hands On a green colored island On a primitive man It was the future reflected It felt familiar but new A street was missing a building The kids had something to do  There was a feeling the spirit was leaving Red like a marker So my tribe, with my knife Cut the heart from a lonely life  I saw patterns on floorboards
When I look out my window Many sights to see And when I look in my window So many different people to be That is strange So strange  You've got to pick up every stitch You've got to pick up every stitch You've got to pick up every stitch Mmm-hmm, must be the season of the witch Must be the season of the witch, yeah Must be the season of the witch  When I look over my shoulder What do you think I see? Some other cat lookin' over
Ooooooooh I'm caught up in the middle But I'll take it to the end It's coming back together And it's breaking down again If I could find a reason I'd say you were my friend If I could find a reason I'd say it once again When I'm with you The days are bittersweet I still can't remember What it feels to be complete Yeaaaah I've tried pretending But it drops off my feet I don't know what it's coming to But I'm looking through the glass darkly
This is the sound of the planes in the night Coming out of the darkness and into the light Shining alarmingly, curiously bright This is the sound of those murderous drums The marching of footsteps the twisting of thumbs Over and over again he recalls  We're lost
Fingernail moon... up in the sky Come out and see me See me some time Cuz I'm here alone Stuck in the blue No distance between us Between me and you I've got nothing to hide I got nothing to loose You'll be by my side Common tell me the truth...  Blah blah blah... You cut like a knife It does me no favors...
Well the scene begins, a little girl is crying And the light in the hallway is dim And the sits right back, thinks of the reason Why nothing will fall into place She gets more and more curious with every day More furious in every way And she screams out loud, "Why's it happening to me?" And the answer is "It's meant to be"  Well she's on her knees And begging please She wonders if there's somebody out there To make things wrong To make things right It might be
Paper bags and plastic hearts All our belongings in shopping carts It's goodbye, but we got one more night Let's get drunk and ride around And make peace with an empty town We can make it right  Throw it away, forget yesterday We'll make the great escape And we won't hear a word they say They don't know us anyway Watch it burn, let it die 'Cause we are finally free, tonight  Tonight will change our lives It's so good to be by your side
Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke Fast lives are stuck in the undertoe But you know the places I wanna go  'Cause, oh, oh, oh I've got a sickness You've got the cure You've got the spunk I've been lookin' for And I've got a plan We walk out the door  No you wanna just let go It's time to roll down the windows Sing it, oh, oh, oh Yeah all we need So here we go  Turn it up It's five minutes to midnight You're coming home with me tonight I can't get enough, shakin' me up  Turn it up Alright At five minutes to midnight You see our name in city lights We'll make the clock stop Make your heart drop And come alive We could Pack up
It's too late baby, there's no turning around I've got my hands in my pocket and my head in a cloud This is how I do When I think about you  I never thought that you could break me apart I keep a sinister smile and a hold of my heart You want to get inside Then you can get in line But not this time  'Cause you caught me off guard Now I'm running and screaming I feel like a hero and you are my heroine  I won't try to philosophize
I got your runaway smile in my piggybank baby Gonna cash it right in for a new Mercedes You were worth the hundred thousand miles But you couldn't stay awhile I got your little brown shirt in my bottom drawer baby And your little white socks in the top drawer You were always leaving your shit around And gone without a sound  Yeah I'm the first to fall And the last to know Where'd you go?

Ye-ah-ah Yeah I would be your man You would be my girl Oh yeah I believe I do  If there's any justice in the world I would be your man You would be my girl oh yeah If I'd found you first you know it's true He would be alone I would be with you  When you decide, don't let me down Coz there's nothing to be certain in my life And you've seen a thousand times There's not much justice in the world Oh no uh 
[Bonus track]  Mother Mother said there's far too many of you crying. All you need is love I believe in love  Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel Listen  Touching you, touching me Touching you, God you're touching me  I believe in a thing called love Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
Baby baby, I feel these sweet sensations, yeah Honey honey, looks like a superstar, yeah yeah She' got a promise of love-struck fascination What am I to do? How am I to know? Who you are?  And this love, fool, osophy is killing Previous illusions that I had in my mind about you Seems so true, all the lies you're telling Tragically compelling and My love it means nothing to you So maybe I'm still a love fool  She shimmers like a California sunset Lady lady, glitters but theres no gold She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas I'm so delirious, is she that serious?

Ooh ooh ooh oohh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh oohh  I will not make the same mistakes that you did I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far  Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me Because of you I am afraid  I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
Don't put your heart in careless hands Those careless hands they don't understand  Sugar and spice and All things nice You won't think twice about Sacrifice  You'll put your heart in careless hands Those careless hands they don't understand  They'll lift you up and they'll Put you down
Dead men lying on the bottom of the grave Wondering when savior comes, is he gonna be saved Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die  They were crying when their sons left God is wearing black He's gone so far to find no hope He's never coming back  They were crying when their sons left All young men must go He's come so far to find the truth
Yeah Alright  Yeah Alright  Two skies Watching it all fading Two skies Living it all fading  Two skies Watching it all fading Two skies fading One's abating  Two suns Living it all dying Two suns fighting One's abiding  Two suns Watching them both fighting Two suns
Such a lonely day And it's mine The most loneliest day of my life Such a lonely day Should be banned It's a day that I can't stand  The most loneliest day of my life The most loneliest day of my life 
I'm lying alone with my head on the phone Thinking of you till it hurts I know you're hurt too, but what else can we do? Tormented and torn apart  I wish I could carry your smile in my heart For times when my life seems so low It would make me believe, what tomorrow could bring When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know  I'm all out of love; I'm so lost without you I know you were right, believing for so long I'm all out of love, what am I without you? I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong  I want you to come back and carry me home Away from these long lonely nights
Drums please  Summer, summer, summertime Time to sit back and unwind  Here it is, the groove slightly transformed Just a bit of a break from the norm Just a little somethin' to break the monotony Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be  A little bit outta control, it's cool to dance But what about the groove that soothes That moves romance? Give me a soft subtle mix An' if ain't broke, then don't try to fix it  An' think of the summers of the past Adjust the base an' let the Alpine blast Pop in my CD an' let me run a rhyme An' put your car on cruise an' lay back 'Cause this is summertime  Summer, summer, summertime Time to sit back and unwind Summer, summer, summertime Time to sit back and unwind  School is out an' it's a sort of a buzz An' back then I didn't really know what it was But now I see what have of this The way that people respond to summer madness
First they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out. Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out. Next they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out. AND THEN THEY CAME FOR ME  This is autonomy- My American Dream Stepped over on the street - Stars and stripes blinding me Their contagious air we breath - My American Dream Classism the black plague - Will mark your grave  This is the second time, we will not fall in line, No you can't stop this exodus No you won't stop this exodus. No you can't stop this exodus
This is the sound of a dropping bomb  After years are we still all content With being pawns in war game chess? Shuffled by King George and his English Queen On a board of autocracy  As fundamentalist citing stories and fables Of whose god is more righteously skilled In whose gods' honor that we are all killed...  A dead ringer for Armageddon
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  I did my best to make it in the world I plowed by sweat in tears into the fertile Generation, generation, generated what was needed For supply to meet demand  The sun shone bright on the ancient range Then the promise of the future turned the Neo-Liberal Plain The people's voice shut up, shut down, abstain Is it gonna take a martyr to end the charade?  They tell you that you're out of luck While people fall they watch their profits rocket up  S.O.S., this is a global call You better make a stand You better make it now Take back your rights from the IMF, World Bank and Monsanto  S.O.S., this is a global call You better make a stand
Woah oh Woah oh Woah oh Woah oh  I woke up sweat soaked in the morning I was mourning freedom buried deep. Mourning freedom buried deep. In tickers and broadcasts through power lines. Freedom buried in sound bites, buried in headlines  And we sing Woah oh Woah oh Woah oh Woah oh  A nation in fervor has given up. No, no, no, this fight has just begun. With movements and revolutions as few and far between. As movements and revolutions will ever come to be 
Say Mrs. Dali Lamas Another sister's shootin' heroin tomorrow 'S amputees in Freetown Sierra Leone's The church wasn't honest The state put the youth in a harness Creatin' hostility among us The teacher said no college Still the kid's gotta get a check with a couple commas People wanna bomb us More people gotta scatter and run from us You can blame it on Zeus and Apollo and Adonis  But what you've done here Is put yourself between a bullet and a target And it won't be long before You're pulling yourself away  What you've done here Is put yourself between a bullet and a target And it won't be long before
See I will carry you through the hurricane waters And I'll remember you in the blue skies See I will carry you in the hurricane waters And I'll remember you in the blue skies  Something happens when You're caught searching for an answer When you're stuck in the middle Of a place that you don't belong, yeah  When you start to lose sight of What's right and wrong, yeah

Underneath this smile lies everything All my hopes and anger Pride and shame Make myself a pact not to shut doors on the past Just for today I am free  I will not lose my faith It's an inside job today I know this one thing well  I used to try to kill love Was the highest sin Breathing insecurity out and in Searching hope
Hey-ey-ey snowflake My pretty little snowflake Ooh, ooh, the change in the weather Has made it better for me  Hey-ey-ey snowflake, my pretty little snowflake You've got me warm as a fire With the burning desire for you.  Snow was falling when love came calling On this lonely heart of mine. You were standing there with snow flakes in your hair  You kept stalling while my thoughts were calling
Well, I woke this morning with a teardrop in my eye Because last night it felt like the best night of my life Now there's something that is wrong, rotting my insides And I don't understand why my brain wants to die?  I had women, wine, party time and everything that mattered And when I woke up today you know my brain was all in tatters I had bits of lungs, shrapnel glass, cigarettes for breakfast And my lips are blue, my toes are numb and I think I've got the shivers  It's the little things we do when we go out in the night
Well, sometimes I go out by myself And I look across the water And I think of all the things, what you do And in my head, I make a picture 'Cause since I've come on home Well, my body's been a mess And I've missed your ginger hair And the way you like to dress  Won't you come on over? And stop makin' a fool out of me And why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie  Did you have to go to jail Put your house up on for sale

Until the oceans all run dry Until the stars fall from the sky Even if words don't seem to rhyme I'll be addicted to your smile  And if the wind blows out the sun I'll still believe you are the one No matter what we're going through I'll plan to spend my night with you  I promise you, my heart won't fade I swear to you, my soul always It isn't hard to understand You're making me a better man
I wanna love somebody I hear you need somebody to love Oh, I wanna love somebody I hear you're looking for someone to love  'Cause you need to Get back in the arms of a good friend And I need to Get back in the arms of a girlfriend  I didn't know nobody And then I saw you coming my way Well, I didn't know nobody
If one could stop time Or make it up If two could realize The best of luck If I could locate God above And you only wanted To be loved  Then I'd try to hang on To the past But you know That nothin' Oh no, nothin' lasts Nothin' lasts
Distant flickering, greener scenery This weather's bringing it all back again Great adventures, faces in condensation I'm going outside and take it all in  You say too late to start Got your heart in a headlock I don't believe any of it You say too late to start With your heart in a headlock You know you're better than this  Wear a different pair, just something out of step Throw a stranger an unexpected smile With big intention, still posted at your station Always on about the day it should have flown  You say too late to start Got your heart in a headlock
Say goodnight and go  Skipping beats Blushing cheeks I am struggling Daydreaming Bed scenes in The corner cafe And then I'm left in bits recovering, tectonic Trembling You get me every time  Why'd you have to be so cute? It's impossible to ignore you Oh, must you make me laugh so much? It's bad enough we get along so well Say goodnight and go  Follow you home You've got your headphones on And you're dancing
Where are we? what the hell is going on? The dust has only just began to fall Crop circles in the carpet, sinking, feeling Spin me around again and rub my eyes This can't be happening When busy streets a mess with people would stop to hold their heads heavy  Hide and seek Trains and sewing machines? All those years they were here first  Oily marks appear on walls Where pleasue moments hung before
Just for now, just for now, just for now Just for now, just for now, just for now  It's that time of year Leave all our hopelessnesses aside If just for a little while Tears stop right here I know we've all had a bumpy ride I'm secretly on your side  How did you know? It's what I always wanted You can never have had too many of these Will ya quit kicking me under the table? I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it? Can we settle down please? 
We met as soul mates On Parris Island We left as inmates From an asylum And we were sharp As sharp as knives And we were so gung ho To lay down our lives  We came in spastic Like tameless horses We left in plastic As numbered corpses And we learned fast To travel light Our arms were heavy But our bellies were tight  We had no home front We had no soft soap They sent us Playboy They gave us Bob Hope
Blank face in the windowpane Made clear in seconds of light Disappears and returns again Counting hours, searching the night  Might be waiting for someone Might be there for us to see 
I can't see the meaning of this life I'm leading I try to forget you as you forgot me This time there is nothing left for you to take This is goodbye  Summers is miles and miles away And no one would ask me to stay  And I should contemplate this change To ease the pain And I should step out of the rain Turn away 
Out on the road there are fireflies circling Deep in the woods, where the lost souls hide Over the hill there are men returning Trying to find some peace of mind  Sleep my child 
In the corner beside my window Hangs a lonely photograph There is no reason I'd never notice a memory that could hold me back  There is a wound that's always bleeding There is a road I'm always walking And I know you'll never return to this place 
There's nobody here There's nobody near I try not to care Dead eyes always stare Let these matters be Don't trust what you see Take hold of your time Step into the line 
Please remedy my confusion And thrust me back to the day The silence of your seclusion Brings night into all you say  Pull me down again And guide me into pain  I'm counting nocturnal hours Drowned visions in haunted sleep Faint flickering of your powers Leaks out to show what you keep  Pull me down again
Candelabra snuffed, prey - silhouette wedded Nightfall take my hand Seduce me with silky timbred limbs Grant me thy dark command  Over the peaks framing tapestries Of thick forest, dusk has filled With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist Creeping like violations from the shadows to kill  Lucretia is my love in vein When thy tears bleed sweeter Than the midsummer rain?  Bewinged, infested belfries Toll o'er the sobbing throng A writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes Whipped and welted 'neath the barbed windsong...  (In sadean paradise ancestral legacies linger on...)  I am He, the crowned and conquering darkness Satan robed in ecumenical filth Livid Bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of slyph  This wintry eve when the snow glistens deep And sharpened turrets wed the jewelless skies I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep Embroided by these words Malaresia scribed
Care for a little necrophilia? Hmm?  I was born with a birthmark of cinders Debris cast from the stars and mother A ring of bright slaughter I spat in the waters of life That ran slick from the stabwounds in her  Dub me Lord Abortion, the living dead The bonesaw on the backseat On this bitter night of giving head A sharp rear entry, an exit in red Lump in the throat, on my cum choke The killing joke worn thin with breath  I grew up on the sluts bastard father beat blue Keepsake cunts cut full out easing puberty through  Aah! Nostalgia grows Now times nine or ten Within this vice den called a soul Dying for resurrection I dig deep to come again The spasm of orgasm on a roll  I live the slow serrated rape The bucks fizz of amyl nitrate Victims force fed their own face Tear stains upon the drape I should compare them To a warm Summer's day But to the letter, it is better To lichen their names to a grave
Everyone is crying out for peace, yes None is crying out for justice  Everyone is crying out for peace, yes None is crying out for justice I don't want no peace I need equal rights and justice I need equal rights and justice  I need equal rights and justice Got to get it equal rights and justice Everybody want to go to heaven but nobody want to die (follow us, Jesus) Everybody want to go up to heaven but none of them, none of them want to die  I don't want no peace I, man need equal rights and justice I got to get it, equal rights and justice I really need it, equal rights and justice Just give me my share, equal rights and justice
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone It's not warm when she's away Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And she's always gone too long Anytime she's goes away  Wonder this time where she's gone Wonder if she's gone to stay Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And this house just ain't no home
I want to spend the night With you forever Every time we wind up spending the night together Do you ever feel it? I want to share my life With you forever Every time we wind up sharing a night together Do you ever feel it? 
Grandma's hands Clapped in church on Sunday morning Grandma's hands Played a tambourine so well Grandma's hands Used to issue out a warning She'd say, Billy don't you run so fast Might fall on a piece of glass Might be snakes there in that grass Grandma's hands  Grandma's hands
Hey...  Uh huh...  Well all right...  How y'all doin? Yes ma'am... lookin' mighty fine...  I've been around the world, Seen so many pretty girls, But i still get overwhelmed, when I look in your eyes...  Been from Maine to Spaine, But everything seems the same, But I only feel a change, when I look in your eyes...
A bad note ain't no bad note If it's a good note A bad note ain't no bad note If it's a good note A bad note ain't no bad note
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin' On this, our weddin' day Do not forsake me, oh my darlin' Wait, wait along  I do not know what fate awaits me I only know I must be brave And I must face a man who hates me Or lie a coward, a craven coward Or lie a coward in my grave
Lay Your World On Me I know you think you're all alone I haven't been there when you've needed me I didn't deserve the love you gave But now I'm telling you I'm here if you need a friend  Give me your pain Give me your anger Let me be your rock I can be the pillar of strength that you need I'll help you keep it all together It's better late than never Lay your world on me I can take the weight
Your words, they go right through me They circle round my head, yeah I can't believe I'm still here I know I should be dead, yeah This desperation makes me feel so filthy But I know if I don't stop I won't feel guilty Take me higher Crank me faster Help me get the thrill I'm after  One time to take away all pain One more to turn myself insane
She's got you high and you don't even know yet She's got you high and you don't even know yet The sun's in the sky, its warming up your bare legs You can't deny your looking for the sunset  She's got you high and you don't even know yet She's got you high and you don't even know yet It's the search for the time before it leaves without you Have you lost your mind or has she taken all of yours too? Whats this about? I figured love would shine through We've lost romance this world has turned so see through Open your mind, believe it's going to come to Romance alive and hope she's going to tell you.  She's got you high and you don't even know yet
When I look at you I can see the sadness in your eyes In these desperate times We get pushed and shoved from every side  I can't love you if you won't let me Can't touch me if you don't try I can feel you, I know that you're ready To take it to the other side  Love will keep us alive Let's make the moment right, it's now or never Love will keep us alive Even the darkest night will shine forever Love will keep us alive Love will keep us alive Love, love will keep us alive  When you walk away
One is the cause And two is mysterious, Three is the wisest, Four is so powerful  Five with such kindness, Six is always in love, Seven the chariot, Eight will rule them all!  Nine is a hermit, Ten is just probable, Eleven is virtuous, Twelve's hanging down a rope!
I caught you cryin' Tryin' to hide your tears away And all the while I never knew you felt this way I've loved you from the start How could we let this come apart?  We've got to put The sun back in our hearts  Through the alleyways The avenues and dreary days
Outside the factory gates For hours sit and wait For you to turn around And show me there's a way  I am a stranger to the life Enchanted by the wonders of the night  I stepped into the dark With all the broken hearts I'm searching empty streets Distant and apart  I am a stranger in this life Haunted by yesterday's desires  When we meet again You'll know I am to blame
She watched the sky as it bathes into black Watched with the lovers that never came back The princes and kings, all the beautiful things And more  She won't wait, she'll never look back Through the morgue where the mirrors have crashed She slides through a dream with all her beautiful schemes And more  She's got a reason to roam with the stars Watch her go as she sings Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara ra ra
You know you, you make me feel so good inside I always wanted a girl just like you Such a P.Y.T., Pretty Young Thing, ooh  Where did you come from, lady?

Lately there seems to be some insecurities About the way I feel where I wanna be Boy you know it's with you No one can do the things you do to me  Never to be mistaking long as it's love we're making There'll be no hesitating you and me And it always will be and I wont leave your side 'Cause you know  Love will be right here, be right here Right here, be right here No fear, have no fear No tears love is here  True love some don't believe in That's just what I'm giving I'm gonna keep it strong I'll be holding on to you No one can do me like you do it's true  Sure as the sun is shining our love will keep on climbing There's gonna be some rain gonna be some pain But as long as I know boy time will show Our love will grow and I know

Go... So fucking determined Yeah, yeah go... You better believe it, confidence Go... So fucking determined Yeah, yeah go... Spit out all reason Yeah  I'm tired of holdin' up the weight The weight of the motherfuckin' world. All I want is just to get right here Right now. We struggle and fight just to get in a grave That's overflowing Clock's ticking on my fifteen minutes of fame  Come on now, one two three go So fucking determined Yeah, yeah go... You better believe it, confidence Go... So fucking determined Yeah, yeah go... Spit out all reason  Yeah I'm flushing the trust of everyone Stabbing in the back and thinkin' they can break me Set my sight can't die 'till I'm done, mind endurance Never wanted anymore than what I deserve
In this hole that is me The dead are rolling over In this hole thickening Dirt shoveled over shoulders  I feel it in me So overwhelmed Oh, this pressured center rising My life overturned Unfair the despair All these scars keep ripping open  Peel me from the skin Tear me from the rind Does it make you happy now? Tear meat from the bone Tear me from myself Are you feeling happy now?  In this hole that is me A life that's growing feeble In this hole so limiting
And the words they take their meaning (It's all you said) And the flame, it loses colour (It's all you said) Take take take a while, take a while (It's all you said)  Knowing that it's far from over This one belongs to you  Time shows us that all that ever mattered All that ever mattered leaves us in the cold If you ever believe this is what you need It will spin around and shatter Throw you to the floor As it leaves us in the cold
Dreams of earth quakes Dreams of hurricanes Dreams of pouring rain Dreams of tidal waves to wash us all away Dreams of guns blazed Dreams of fire rage Dreams of swollen graves Dreams of hollow pain All gone  No more fallen No more enemy No more casualty No more dream  Fall into sleep, fall into me I have a dream But nobody cares, nobody wants to listen Fall into sleep, fall into me Hang onto a dream, that nobody wants
In the mornin' I was weary Oh, in the mornin' I was lost But in the evenin' I was dreamin' Of our love an' the way it carries on  In the city, I was workin' Feelin' busy, chasin' time But when I'm tired, she's my fire 'Cause I know that her love is always mine  She assures me That when life hurts me
Repeating in my head Betrayal Repeating in my head Insecurities Repeating in my head Dividends  It's not your fault The well of thought and trust has run dry Don't be afraid to let go Don't be afraid to start over when it's over  Let go Let go Let go Let go  Let go of feelings Let go of compromise Hollow trunk for shelter So dark and cold inside I always seem to find myself alone Jaded shell of being Porous as a stone  Calloused Rigid Empty Because of you  Let go of trusting Lost thought for family Let go of living No more concerns of demise I never seem to find rhythm for life's harmony  Contorted Twisted broken Without a reason  Calloused
It's your time now, baby Oh, but it's gonna be mine after awhile I said, it's your time right now, baby Lord, but it's gonna be mine after awhile You know, you know if things don't change I'm gonna move on down  She stayed out last night And do you know she just walked in The girl is gettin' ready She's going back out again I said, just wait one minute
I get my kicks from rock and roll A 12 bar boogie gonna bless my soul Wanna dance to that rhythm Get down to that rockin' beat I don't wanna play no heavy jazz With high class music And its stuffed shirt nights 'Cos I wanna be a rock 'n roll star And make my money out of playin' guitar Cos I'm a rock and roller I'm gonna rock it, gonna roll all over
He stands alone outside the blooming yard All is calm there on the street The shadows pass him hung right over The pain on his face he knew he'd keep... His hair is long, and it's twisted, it's twisted Around the smile spread cheek to cheek Another child, another soul, grabs a hold To the metal that will end his misery...  One by one We stand beneath the sun With arms high open wide Two by two He's getting you To watch him as he leaves this life he knew  How much anger is set aside
I'll be there Always waiting Waiting for you To let me inside Where your fire burns In a city of angels  Just like a river rushing straight into the sea I'm the one thing meant for you and you for me  Whatever you want Whatever you need Whatever it takes, I'll do anything (anything)  And as you sleep Eyes to the window I'm watching you dream Well, are you dreaming of me?
Ha ha, ha ha Whoa ooh Ha ha, ha ha Ha ha ha Ha ha, ha ha Whoa ooh Ha ha, ha ha  Why can't you Just tell the truth (Why) Why is it So hard for you Tell me What you think When you mess around Do you see my face (Do you see me?) When she's goin' down?  If you really knew (Oh no oh) What I know about you You'd be surprised Couldn't look me In my eyes Hey Sittin' home alone Waitin' by the phone Oh no Not me Your not the only one Creepin'  Your not the Only one (Ha, ha, ha, ha) Don't know why I'm messin' Wit'cha (Ha, ha, ha, ha) That's why I do the thangs You do (Ha, ha, ha, ha) But I can't help it I love ya (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Look, you don't have to take this You can come with me  So hard to believe she left you alone all alone I know babe, you can come with me though So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone, all alone I know babe, you can come with me though  I know you're alone, you can come with me though I know you feel pain, you can come with me though I know you feel hurt, you can come with me though It wouldn't be the same, if you come with me though  I just couldn't believe, believe it babe That she would go and treat you that way Especially after all the craziness you took It just ain't necessary  I can feel the tears that you cry at night 'Cause I know what love supposed to be like Every little kiss and hug that she put aside Baby if you want to I can make it right  So hard to believe, she left you alone all alone I know babe, you can come with me though So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone, all alone I know babe, you can come with me though  I know you're alone, you can come with me though I know you feel pain, you can come with me though I know you feel hurt, you can come with me though
[Chorus  Chris Lee] You're all that I need The simple things you do for me you keep comin' through I must say that I'm impressed I know you love the whole world, seems I'm the only one you know 'Cause you're so personal You got me sayin' like oooohh, because you're fillin' my cup Oooohhh, I just can't get enough So let it be known, wouldn't trade your love for nothin' You see, you're all that I need  [Verse 1  Flame] Lord you're so holy, in a league of your own You didn't owe me but remember you took Francis Jones You gave me everything when my grandmother died The greatest gift of all, you when you opened my eyes Lord my heart was broke seein' her in there dead In the hospital doctor pronouncing her dead You took my best friend, at the time I was blind Hard to look ahead, hard to put the past behind But like Isaiah 6 when King Uzziah died I saw you Lord, seated on the throne lifted high I saw you Lord, in a way I never seen before
Poisoning a drink Bleeding in a sink Choking with a link Killing with a stink Just your mother's Ho  Bleeding in a sink Poisoning a drink Burning up My sweet Clementine  Trampling a shrink Bleeding in a sink Hallelujah, wink Getting on the brink Just your mother's Ho  Hallelujah, wink Murdering a shrink Burning up  All my sweet revenge Will be yours for the taking It's in the making, baby 
Oh no, this couldn't be more unexpected And I can tell that I've been moving in so slow Don't let it throw you off too far 'Cause I'll be running right behind you  Could this be out of line? To say you're the only one Breaking me down like this You're the only one I would take a shot on Keep me hanging on So contagiously  Oh, when I'm around you I'm predictable 'Cause I believe in loving you at first sight
Da da ra ra ra ra ra Da ra ra ra ra ra Da ra ra ra ra ra ra  Da ra ra ra ra ra ra Da ra ra ra ra ra Da ra ra ra ra ra ra  Grew up in a small town And when the rain would fall down I'd just stare out my window Dreaming of what could be And if I'd end up happy I would pray (I would pray)  Trying hard to reach out But when I tried to speak out Felt like no one could hear me Wanted to belong here But something felt so wrong here So I prayed I could break away  I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Well now, ooh wee baby, you know I Claire, you sure look fine I said, ooh whee baby, you know I Claire, you sure look fine  Well there's a girl like you a make a minute man change his mind I said, baby, when you walk you know you shake like a willow tree
Everybody's talkin' But they don't say a thing They look at me with sad eyes But I don't want the sympathy It's cool you didn't want me Sometimes you can't go back Why'd you have to go and make a mess like that  Well I just have to say before I let go Have you ever been low? Have you ever had a friend that let you down so? When the truth came out Were you the last to know? Were you left out in the cold?  'Cause what you did was low No I don't need your number There's nothing left to say 'Cept I never thought it'd hurt this much to be saved My friends are outside waiting I've gotta go 
Blue the color suits you cool blue How will you stay this way for ever? Blue again it's a lasting chill To keep you cold as winter  How can I forget you? I'm never gonna give you up, up I said How can I forget you baby? I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  Here it comes again Here it comes again Here it comes again Here it comes again 
Something that I said Made you wear a frown The way you hang your head Has made the tears come down  But don't you wear a sigh My beautiful child  You know it doesn't burn When you touch the sun So don't be concerned My golden one  You're gonna reach the sky
Stop the world, turn out the sun I'm so tired of it turning round Stop the world, call it a day Leave it all behind, leave it that way  Peace, is just a word, is just a word Peace, is just a word, yeah  Stop the world, just let it bleed Well, we've taken more than everything we need Stop the world, just shut it down
The truth of life is the greatest gift But I don't think I can make it fit And who would guess it would come to this When I've tried everything  And I should know but I can't explain The endless noise sounding in my brain
Don't be afraid when you walk through the dark Just when you feel that your day fell apart Stay strong keep holding on Clear skies ahead and the dark day is done  Keep on lifted, keep on lifted  I wish you everything that you could want Just when the day finds you turned back to front
Why do you hurt yourself? You do it very well You do it so politely That you couldn't even tell When everything has changed You think you're not to blame How come you keep on talking When the whole thing feels so strange?...  But seeing is not the same as believing When everything goes wrong You're anything but strong  It's all bittersweet Outside in the street The grass is growing greener Underneath your feet
Sweet dreams are made of this Who am I to disagree? I travelled the world and the seven seas Everybody's looking for something  Some of them want to use you Some of them want to get used by you Some of them want to abuse you Some of them want to be abused  Sweet dreams are made of this Who am I to disagree? I travelled the world and the seven seas Everybody's looking for something  Hold your head up Keep your head up Movin' on Hold your head up
Six o'clock in the morning And I'm stepping through the streets The pavement's cold and empty Got the blues beneath my feet. Big old sun is rising up So elegant and thin Another day is over So a new day will begin
I need you to pin me down just for one frozen moment I need someone to pin me down so I can live in torment I need you to really feel the twist of my back breaking I need someone to listen to the ecstasy I'm faking  I need you, you, you I need you, you, you  I need you to catch each breath that issues from my lips I need someone to crack my skull, I need someone to kiss So hold me now and make pretend that I won't ever fall
Put the blame on me Put the blame on me  Take me to a dark room And hug me to bits I just wanna be kissed so badly Right there on my lips  Put the blame on me Put the blame on me  Why did you close your eyes When I'm the one that's blind? Why did you close your eyes?

Tell me have you heard the story That took place not long ago Bout an angel up in heaven They say she up and ran away from home  Word is she had unfinished business So back on earth she had to flee Well you know I'm so elated Because she's laying right here next to me  And when God woke up that morning And he called out her name
By the time you get this letter I might be doin better It's kinda hard trying to survive In all this crazy weather.  Everybody wants my number Everybody's callin my name But in the midst of all of this I can still hear you say.  Son, walk upright And straighten yo tie You don't want one of those good jobs to pass you by Don't act no fool, I'm watching you And now that you're gone It still feels like you do, I Wish  I wish u were here To see the things I've done I wish u were here You'd be so proud of your son I wish u were here To celebrate with me I wish u were here.  Now all of these people ask me
Forgive us our trespasses As we forgive those who have trespassed against us Give us this day our daily bread Daily bread, daily bread  In cello et in terra fiat voluntas tua Gloria Spiritui Sancto  What language do you speak if you speak at all? Are you some kind of freak Who lives to raise the ones who fall? Hey, would you tell me why the cat fights the dog? Do you go to the mosque or the synagogue?  And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger And if you wrote the script, then why the troublemakers?  How do you do? How does it feel to be so high? And are you happy? Do you ever cry? (I sometimes cry)  You've made mistakes Well, that's okay 'cause we all have But if I forgive yours Will you forgive mine?  Hey, do you feel our pain and walk in our shoes?

This house is full of emptiness My closet's full of dresses that I'll never wear My life is full of people But you're my only friend, my best friend  Hope it isn't too late to say "I love you" Hope it isn't too late to say that without you This place looks like London, it rains every day

Son, look at all the people in this restaurant What do you think they weigh? Out the window to the parking lot At their SUV's, taking all of the space  They give no fuck They talk as loud as they want They give no fuck Just as long as there's enough, for them  Gonna get on the microphone down at Wal-Mart
Pale, pubescent beasts Roam through the streets And coffee-shops  Their prey gather in herds Of stiff knee-length skirts And white ankle-socks  But while they search for a mate My type hibernate In bedrooms above  Composing their songs of love  Young, uniform minds In uniform lines
I know that you're in there I can see you You're saying you're okay I don't believe you  And now that the gig is up, the spell is broken The fat lady's sung, the president has spoken These days that you were waiting for will come and go Like any day, just another day  There's never gonna be a moment of truth for you While the world is watching, ohh ohh Ohh, all you need is the thing you've forgotten And that's to learn to live with what you are
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la  Lyin' awake, I turn to you You are softly sleeping I think of what I'd like to do While you are somewhere dreaming I, I feel so happy by your side Oh why, I wonder, wonder, wonder why  Find it hard to find the words To say what I am feeling I'm so in love, I'm so alive And I know you're the reason why Why, I'm so happy all the time? Oh why, I wonder, wonder, wonder why?  I need nothing else in life than to hold you I, oh, I am in so deep, I don't need no sleep I just need you here with me
Fortunately you have Got someone who relies on you We started out as friends But the thought of you just caves me in The symptoms are so deepIt is much too late to turn away We started out as friends  Sign your name across my heart I want you to be my baby Sign your name across my heart I want you to be my lady  Time I'm sure will bring Disappointments in so many things It seems to be the way When you're gambling cards on love you playI'd rather be in hell with you, baby
Kissing like a bandit stealing time Underneath the sycamore tree Cupid by the hour sends valentines To my sweet lover and me  Slowly but surely Your appetite is more than I knew Sweetly, softly I'm falling in love with you  Wish me love a wishing well, to kiss and tell A wishing well of butterfly tears Wish me love a wishing well, to kiss and tell A wishing well of crocodile cheers, sing  Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do Right beside a riverboat gambler
I must've died and gone to heaven 'Cause it was quarter past eleven On a Saturday in 1999 Right across from where I'm standing On the dance floor she was landing It was clear that she was from another time  Like some baby Barbarella With the stars as her umbrella She asked me if I'd like to magnetise Do I have to go star-trekking 'Cause it's you I should be checking So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes  She's just a cosmic girl From another galaxy My heart's at zero gravity She's from a cosmic world Putting me in ecstasy Transmitting on my frequency She's cosmic 
Baby baby, I feel these sweet sensations Honey, honey, looks like a superstar She's got a promise of love struck fascination  What am I to do? How am I to know? Who you are.  And this love-fool-osophy is killing previous Illusions that (I'm a love fool) I had in my mind about you, I'm a love fool Seems so true, all the lies you're telling Tragically compelling (I'm a love fool) and my love it means Nothing to you So maybe I'm still a love fool  She shimmers like a California sunset Lady, lady glitters but there's no gold
(B-Real) How many times have we been thru this I can tell you that it's getting harder everytime I try to resist We go way back and you held me down Helped my feet moving on the ground No matter what situation ocasion You were amazing, you knew just what it took to keep dough up blazing (?) I kept you by me, but when we seperated I was thinkin foolishly Remember when your Ex-Boy tried to bug on me I told to bring it on and (?) on me He didn't like that but didn't want the fight Fuck 'im, he didn't know how to treat you right We go hand in hand they don't understand a man But you do and I really respect that, damn We been down so long but it's all good That's why I dedicate this song  (Chorus: repeat 2X) Till Death Do Us Part I do  (Verse Two: B-Real)
I love me some him I'll never love this way again I love me some you Another man will never do  I love me some him I'll never love this way again I love me some you Another man will never do  All those days and lonely nights Have all gone away I never thought the day would come When we'd more than friends You made me smile when I was down You turn my world around The way you give me love feel so right  You took the ease off my mind And put it behind You were there for all my needs So baby - stay
Hey, hey, hold up a minute Let me stop up here and use this payphone real quick  Hey, hey, Toni, it's me, I was just callin' ya know Just callin' to let you know Don't wait up for me tonight I mean I just got a couple of things on my mind I gotta think about you know  Just uhm, I'll be over at Brian's house You know just for the night I mean, I mean I know things are different But you know it's not you, it's me You know, it's really me You know Basically I just think I'ma need some space  Why you callin' me on the phone? Why you not at home on time? You say you're stayin' over your friends 'Cause you got alot on your mind Now you're swearin' up and down that it ain't me Still you say that things have changed So tell me what exactly does it mean When you say you need your space? Just don't make no excuses, no, no  Why you gotta lie to me? Just be a man about it Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no Just be a man about it If you wanna leave (I can tell you wanna leave), go on now
Don't leave me in all this pain Don't leave me out in the rain Come back and bring back my smile Come and take these tears away I need your arms to hold me now The nights are so unkind Bring back those nights when I held you beside me  Un-break my heart Say you'll love me again Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life Un-cry these tears I cried so many nights Un-break my heart My heart  Take back that sad word good-bye Bring back the joy to my life
Seven whole days And not a word from you Seven whole nights I'm just about thru I can't take it, won't take it Can't take it no more I had about enough of you  I'd rather be on my own  Yes on my own  Darlin' darlin' You know if you cared anything about love You woulda been front and center Lovin' me and touchin' me Honey Honey You know if you knew anything about me You woulda been much more tender Ooh squeezin' me, caressin' me You coulda had about anything you wanted But you messed it up You had to be tough You told your friends You had me wrapped around your finger You were talking kinda cocky Like you had it goin' on All the while you knew That things were kinda shaky You knew that you were wrong  Dead wrong to be Mistreating me  How can we go on Seven whole days
Bleached by the Sun And scorched by the Moon If I make it 'til tomorrow noon I'm leaving 'Tween the horror of space And the terror of time My heart is crystal, down the line I'm screaming  CHORUS What I need is a kiss from you, babe Before it's hangover time What I need is some love from you, babe Before this stampede arrives
That night her kiss told me it was over I walked out late into the dark The misty gloom seems to soak up my sorrow The further I went on I felt a spreading calm Then suddenly my eyes were bathed in light And the lovely lady in white was by my side She said "Like me I see you're walking alone Won't you please stay?" I couldn't look away
(Speaking) What we gonna do right here Is take you way back Way back into time My man Ginuwine For all y'all people out there Bobby to the speaker It's sung by me Now, Ginuwine speaking  Dig if you will the picture Of you and I engaged in a kiss The sweat of your body covers me Can you my darling Can you picture this  Dream if you can a courtyard An ocean of violets in bloom Animals strike curious poses They feel the heat
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah Oh, yeah, babe  My whole life has changed Since you came in, I knew back then You were that special one I'm so in love, so deep in love You make my life complete You are so sweet, no one competes Glad you came into my life You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight  Girl, you open me, I'm wide open And I'm doing things I never do But I feel so good, I feel so good Why'd it take so long, me finding you This is my story and I'm telling you It's not fiction, it's surely a fact Without you right here having my back I really don't know just where I'd be at  My whole life has changed (My whole life has changed) Since you came in, I knew back then (Ooh... oh...) You were that special one (You were baby) I'm so in love, so deep in love
I am a poor, wayfaring stranger Wandering o'er this world of woe But there's no sickness, no toil no danger That bright land to which I go  I'm going home to see my father I'm going home, no more to roam I'm only going over Jordan I'm just a going over home 
Follow your heart and see where it might take you Don't let the world outside there break you They know not who you are inside They have never felt your hell Don't ever let them crack  Hold out I know you feel it getting cold out Without the blanket for your soul now Before you know it you'll be frozen You have to see this through There's no one here but you  I feel the rain coming down
Look to the clock on the wall Hands hardly moving at all I can't stand the state that I'm in Sometimes it feels like the walls closing in  Oh, Lord, what can I say? I am so sad since You went away Time, time, ticking on me Alone is the last place I wanted to be Lord, what can I say?  Trap all my troubles away Drowns my sorrows the same way
Dear love I miss you much I miss your smile and I miss your touch But I found a place where I can erase my past Maybe someday when you're old and gray And your hair falls out and your tattoos fade You might see me standing, hat in hand  I have to go away I've got no reason to stay here You said someday you'll change
Hold me down lift me up There's someone on the bedside waiting there for me I hear my name, turn around There's gotta be a downside, something I don't see Around me  Hide me Dying in the light of the room Blind side please I don't really want to be seen In my own eyes  Something's wrong Awake all night 'Cause I can feel the dark side
Sorry, I'm only Human, you know me Grown up, oh no guess again  My days always Dry up and blow away Sometimes I could do that too But make no mistake that  When you need a friend You could count on anyone
Long is the day, take it away Hold it up and you don't let it fall Cause devil's play was yesterday And I don't care about that at all  I just smile, once in a while Cause I don't want the lines on my face And I sit right here, holdin' the years And I count all the stars in space  You fall apart again And you can find a friend Don't turn to someone else Cause they won't understand  Self respect, goes unexpressed
Maybe I've been the problem, maybe I'm the one to blame But even when I turn it off and blame myself, the outcome feels the same I've been thinkin' maybe I've been partly cloudy, maybe I'm the chance of rain And maybe I'm overcast, and maybe all my lucks washed down the drain  I've been thinking 'bout everyone, everyone You look so lonely  But when I look at the stars When I look at the stars When I look at the stars I see someone else When I look at the stars The stars, I feel like myself 
Looking at your picture from when we first met You gave me a smile that I could never forget And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night  Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me  I just want you to know That I've been fighting to let you go Some days I make it through And then there's nights that never end  I wish that I could believe That there's a day you'll come back to me But still I have to say I would do it all again Just want you to know 
Listen to the monkey Feeding on your brain I feel okay No pain!  I'm tired of shocking junkie Suckin' on your veins Forget no ways No ways!  I'm tired of running hunchback I've been tripping now for days And there is no way You don't say!  I got my drip drab velcro moustache
When the days are quiet All alone inside the silence I can hear the raindrops Tapping rhythm to the hours  I play some music, sing my loneliness So quiet I remain  And the light so quiet
You can't always be fabulous or in control Sometimes you just got to roll With the punches or the punch bowl I can handle a few new names  Call me punch rocker puncherella Punch master Peter punchkin' head Punchy Maggie Addie punch face girl So punch in your karaoke for Princess Punchanokie you betta get to know me I pack a mean punch  I'm a punch rocker I'm a punch rocker I'm a punch rocker I'm a punch, punch, punch, punch rocker 
I saw her last night Standing in the crowd And in a sudden flash of glory I was blinded And though everything was moving My whole world came to stop Now I need to know Please I need to know  Who's that girl? Tell me what's her name Who's that girl? Does she feel the same Who's that girl? Huh, this is no ordinary crush If I have to I'll go halfway round the world Who's that girl?  Angeleyes of mine
Wandering the streets in a world underneath it all Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have  Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel about you  Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have And cannon ball into the water I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have For you I will For you I will  Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head 'Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes like a water bed  Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
Sitting here counting the hours Waiting for the sun to kiss the sea Paralyzed by the fragrance of the flowers They remind me of you and me  There's one love in a lifetime Our two hearts of a kind These three reasons you'll be mine For theres five or six ways through Seven days without you Seven days without you
You love to run Into the arms of anyone Take off your shoes And socks and stay awhile  You like the adrenaline rush Just a little too much You go from day to day, hand to mouth And wonder why you're unsatisfied  'Cause love is a marathon That's why you get tired so fast of everyone
Just you know why Why you and I Will by and by Know true love ways  Sometimes we'll sigh Sometimes we'll cry And we'll know why just you and I Know true love ways 
There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me Never have seen a river that's too wide Now there ain't no rope strong enough to bind me Look for me, honey you will find me I'll be there if you ever want me by your side.  So love me if you ever gonna love me
There goes my valentine again Soaked in red for what she said And now she's gone  Oh, my god, have I done it again? There's a pulse and it's deafening I can't help what I hear in my head It's the switch that I flick when he says  (Hand of blood) I don't wanna feel My heart is breaking (Hand of blood) I don't wanna see My life is burning  I saw you look away Is what you've seen too much to take
Even God can't change the past No matter how many tears I've cried Yes, I thought this love would last Who am I to question why? Who am I?  Darling, when I'm hurt That's when I'm satisfied Tell me what it's worth To pursue the Holy life I can see your face Even when I close my eyes I can give you love Even when I've been denied  Who's loving who? Who's fooling who?  Even God can't change the past
I can't believe what is in front of me The water is rising up to my knees And I can't figure out How the hell I wound up here Everything seemed okay when I started out the other day Then the rain came pouring down And now I'm drowning in my fears  And as I watch the setting sun I wonder if i'm the only one Cause everyobody tries to put some love on the line And everybody feels a broken heart sometimes And even when I'm scared I have to try to fly Sometimes I fall But I've seen it done before  I got to step outside these walls
I like the sound of your belt dropping Your door locking, you jangle your keys, yeah I like the sound of your heart stopping Of lip locking, the grazing of knees, yeah I like the sound of skin touching Hands fumbling, you do as you please I like the sound of back on the wall, yeah Shelves falling, oh yes indeed!  And I love it when you call my name I love it when you call my name
Well I don't really mind Where you wanna go 'Cause everybody sometimes Feels the need to be alone Now it's temporary breakdown When there's nothing left to say Show a little faith now 'Cause everything's gonna ok  Well it should come as no surprise When you're dealing with the truth It should be a state of mind Or another point of view So if your confidence is shaken I can promise it won't break Show a little faith now 'Cause everything's gonna ok  When nothing's making sense And the questions never end You gotta let it go Every now and then I can't pretend
He works way too much for way too little He drinks way too early till way too late He hasn't had a raise since New Year's Day In eighty-eight gets trampled on by everyone Except when he comes in here And he's the product of the Haggard generation He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam Says he lost his brother there  He yells out Johnny Cash And the band starts to play A ring of fire as he walks up And stands there by the stage And he says  Hell yeah! Turn it up! Right on! Hell yeah! Sounds good! Sing that song! Guitar man playin' all night long Take me back to where the music hit me Life was good and love was easy

The summer sun went down on our love long ago But in my heart I feel the same old after glow A love so beautiful in every way A love so beautiful we let it slip away 
Yeah  You gave me such a bad time Tried to hurt me But now I know  Thorn in my side You know that's all you ever were A bundle of lies You know that's all that it was worth I should have known better But I trusted you at first I should have known better But I got what I deserved Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Two worlds collide Rival nations It's a primitive clash Venting years of frustration Bravely we hope Against all hope There is so much at stake Seems our freedom's up Against the ropes Does the crowd understand? Is it East versus West Or man against man? Can any nation stand alone?  In the burning Heart Just about to burst There's a quest for answers An unquenchable thirst In the darkest night Rising like a spire In the burning heart The unmistakable fire 
I could hardly believe it When I heard the news today I had to come and get it straight from you  They said you were leavin' Someone's swept your heart away From the look upon your face, I see it's true So tell me all about it Tell me 'bout the plans you're makin' Oh, tell me one thing more before I go  Tell me how am I supposed to live without you Now that I've been lovin' you so long How am I supposed to live without you
Some people think they're always right Others are quiet and uptight Others, they seem so very nice-nice-nice-nice, oh Inside they might feel sad and wrong, oh, no  Twenty-nine different attributes Only seven that you like, oh-oh Twenty ways to see the world, oh And twenty ways to start a fight, oh  Oh don't, don't, don't get up I can't see the sunshine I'll be waiting for you, baby 'Cause I'm through
It's just the two of us A silver cross And some strength that you won't believe See I'm not your friend And I won't pretend That I've come here for peace Well I'm not afraid I'm gonna make you pay I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face  And this is war ... And I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face The time has come To drop the bomb
You, you're me I'm the lock, you're the key You're the air, the air, I breathe But tonight I'm choking  You are my life You are my life  You, you're the sea
Time here, all but means nothing Just shadows that move 'cross the wall They keep me company, but they don't ask of me They don't say nothing at all  And I need just a little more silence And I need just a little more time But you send your thieves to me Silently stalking me Dragging me into your war Would you give me no choice in this? I know you can't resist Trying to re-open a sore  Leave me be, I don't want to argue
I went to the water's edge, forgot I couldn't swim I went to the water's edge, all ready to jump in I saw the water shimmer I heard the wind howl I saw my own reflection I just can't see it now  You say it's the way of the world To somehow co-exist That eventually life unfurls A path to happiness  So, I whisper your little secret
You were my ticket outta here And I was your dream come true You gave me everything I ever wanted Except for you  I convinced my self that over don't mean over And I convinced myself that I could fix it all Two dreams collided maybe We got too excited for our own good  No more, hold on we can make it No more holding each other while the words all break it Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end  Now I convinced myself that nothing could ever tear me away
If I ever find truth I'm gonna let you know If I ever find faith I'm gonna sit in every bit of its afterglow If I ever find a way to bring love here today You better bet your life that this is what I'll say Give it if you've got it Get it if you don't  Take my hand in the meantime And let's walk into the sunshine Everybody got something that they want to sing about, laugh about, cry about It's true For me it's you  Give it away, give it away, give it away If it's something that you got layin' round your house Man let me tell ya if ain't a kiss
I wouldn't sell my belt to industry So they carded me and they carted me off Naked but that belt around my waist It was my father's once, I still see his face  I said whoa, they carted me off Yeah, whoa, they carded me  But I managed to escape the good gendarme I fled through field and farm, stripped of natural charm Naked but that belt I wear so well Past the pyramids and the liberty bell  I said whoa, they carted me off Yeah, whoa, they carded me
Sweep the black super market! Sweep it up with your teeth! Put your feather in a box! (Take off! Take off!) Send it off to me! I smell oxygen, precious. Bareback on your horse. Gallop off course, get off! (Get off! Get off!) Filled with fury's force.  There's a fire in the peach pit, a blaze in the snake pit. (Hey) You erased it but we saw you fake it. There's blood on the good book, love in the bad brook. Suck out all the nerve and make it yours! There's a fire in the peach pit (3x)  Saw you fake it...  You brought me to my knees. Your art, it brought me to my knees.
Tabloids scream Elvis seen at a shopping mall That's the kind of talk That makes my stomach crawl  Picture a zombie Elvis In a tacky white jump suit Just imagine a rotting Elvis Shopping for fresh fruit  You can't 'cause  Elvis is dead Elvis is dead Elvis is dead
Have yourself a merry little Christmas Let your heart be light From now on our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas Make the Yule-tide gay From now on our troubles will be miles away  Here we are as in olden days
Wake up it's time We need to find a better place to hide Make up your mind I need to know I need to know tonight  Sweet and divine Razor of mine Sweet and divine Razorblade shine  Patience my dear
When she goes storming out I run for cover Rolling like thunder clouds Hanging above her Ringing the witching hour Spells that im singing Rain come and drown me out Sinking deep below  Can you go another round I will follow you down and out Let's go another round
Dear haley Can you save me from The borrowed cloud I'm on All you've gotta do is try Pray you're just getting by Hey wait I thought you made it How'd your bottled crown fall off Tell me how'd you get so tired Fade it down to the wire  Try living a lie and kicking out The same old guise Wasting time So very ordinary Wait until my bomb goes off See the actors run and hide Fake it all in stride One day we all can say where we're gone And haunt the ground we're from
Now even though I was only a young buck, I was still trying to kick it Having a gang of fun and much too young to be wicked 'Cause when I was thirteen you know we didn't have cars It was either double ride the peg nuts or hop on the handle bars  And then we went and bought a gang of balloons And had a water balloon fight that lasted until the night Then after that we played some hide and go get it With the neighborhood home girls, dumb enough to be with it  All in fun and games and keeping it cool But my my, when you're kicking it, time flys by 'Cause every hour's a minute and every minute's a sec And if I came home late my moms would ring my neck, yeah  But I regret not the whoopings I got 'Cause to be able to play the next day was okay On a mission to hit up the neighbor's fruit trees Just a bunch of kids chillin', enjoying the summer breeze  Summer breeze, flowing like the wind Boy you need to know that you got a friend and I'll always be here Summer breeze, flowing like the wind Boy you need to know that you got a friend and I'll always be here  Now I'm growing some fuzz, getting older like 17 or 18 And the only thing I know is to stay clean T-shirt, short pants, Nike's on spotless I was even old enough to buy me a cutlass 
What's your mama's name child? What's your mama's name?  Thirty some odd years ago, a young man came to Memphis Askin' 'bout a rose that used to blossom in his world People never took the time to mind the young man's questions Until one day they heard him ask a little green-eyed girl  What's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's name? Does she ever talk about a place called New Orleans?
Jessie is a friend Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine  And she's watching him with those eyes And she's loving him with that body, I just know it Yeah, and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night You know, I wish that I had  Jessie's girl I wish that I had Jessie's girl Where can I find a woman like that?  I'll play along with the charade There doesn't seem to be a reason to change
Life is a sponge ball Thrown with the wild dawn And if I'm gonna swing then I must get motivated  Instead of lyin' in my bed I'm like a train bed Truckin' down a fast hill Heartbreak is overrated  If I'm drying the tears now I can get a head-start out the door  I never loved the sun until it rained I'll never get anywhere if I stay In the same place always afraid of  Gonna just get stuck in a dream Where the answer's clear but no one knows it It's like a toss up, I gotta get of here 'Cause I'm tired of the motions  I'm in blue, no more Walkin' 'round in a circle
Come and get it Did ya hear that cow bell?

Here's another day Another girl left so confused Trying to find a way In the common likes of you But you're so undecided Stringing me along And it hurts just thinking 'bout one day your here and then your gone  Nothing to say Wont hesitate Can't walk away from you You weren't there When I was scared Now all I wanna do is forget about love  So I don't wanna care about love No I don't wanna care about us I don't wanna care at all anymore I used to only care a little bit But now I care way too much Now this love thing I wish I never felt it before I don't wanna care anymore  Trying to brace myself
When the weather is cold When money is low It's better with someone to hold And when the road up ahead Is so unclear I'd rather be together not hear When the circle life throws you a curve Theres someone of better or worse And when you pick up the pace But loosing the race A freindly and familier face  Everyone wants to be kissing on new years eve Underneath the mistletoe While it's snowing outside Making fireworks like it's the forth of July 
So She says it's time she goes But wanted to be sure I know She hopes we can be friends  I think Yeah, I guess we can, say I But didn't think to ask her why She blocked her eyes and drew the curtains With knots I've got yet to untie  What if I were Romeo in black jeans What if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth Maybe she's just looking for Someone to dance with 
I count the cases piled up high For the one-fifteen For platform and for passerby It's the same routine I'm ranting while I'm raving There's nothing here worth saving  Tell me now, what more do you need?

All I want to do is hide

The very first day of my life Was the day that you let me go It was a blessing in disguise Now I see that I'm beautiful  Cause all we ever did was fight We were so dysfunctional Now I've forgotten all the times And all the days I was lovin you  Just like a ghost from my past He's come back to haunt me now Sayin that you want me back But that's impossible so  Love me, leave me Cause I've already closed that door Don't want to be In the pain I felt before  If only I could be myself Without your approval anymore If you love me, leave me If you love me, leave me alone 
You keep on telling me what to do Baby, baby, baby, boo I'm saying, I'm saying goodbye  Give me a moment Give me a minute to look in your eyes I know you know it You get a kick out of making me cry  Think you? re cute when I'm fly Like I can't get another guy You got nerves to sit and laugh Like this is gonna really last  No more hurt, no more lies, no, no, not this time Enough with your lies I believed in this love but you crossed this line
Missy don't think she's pretty no more Starin' at the stars through her back screen door She tries and tries to make it all work out No matter what she does She's left standin' in the middle of doubt  In a lonely night And in the pourin' rain You can count on me  Sometimes she cries When she's alone at night Sometimes she weeps When she's feelin' cold and weak Sometimes the pain It just tears her up inside Sometimes she cries Ooh, I wonder why  Missy don't have a lover no more
I've got a picture of your house And you're standing by the door. It's black and white and faded And it's looking pretty worn. See the factory that I worked Silhouetted in the back. The memories are gray but man they're really coming back. I don't need to be the king of the world As long as i'm the hero of this little girl Heaven isn't too far away Closer to it everyday No matter what your friends might say How I love the way you move And the sparkle in your eyes There's a color deep inside them Like blue suburban skys
Blame it on the Tetons yeah I need a scapegoat now No my dog won't bite you though it had the right to You oughta give her credit Cause she knows I would've let it happen  Blame it on the weekends God I need a Cola now Oh we mumble loudly, wear our shame so proudly Wore our blank expressions tryin' to look interestin'
I backed my car into a cop car the other day Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's ok I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say? Well, you just laughed it off, it was all ok  And we'll all float on, ok And we'll all float on, ok And we'll all float on, ok And we'll all float on anyway, well  A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam It was worth it just to learn from sleight-of-hand Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
6 a.m. day after Christmas I throw some clothes on in the dark The smell of cold, car seat is freezing The world is sleeping, I am numb  Up the stairs to her apartment She is balled up on the couch Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte They're not home to find us out  And we drive Now that I have found someone I'm feeling more alone Than I ever have before  She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
By the look in your eye I can tell you're gonna cry Is it over me?  If it is, save your tears For I'm not worth it You see  For I'm the type of boy Who is always on the roam Wherever I lay my hat, that's my home I'm telling you that's my home  You had romance Did you break it by chance Over me? 
Habit isn't bliss Sunshine isn't missed Happy when you're cold Wanna be alone  He's a lot of steam She's alot of breath Takes a lot to see Takes a lot to beg  CHORUS
You try to read me, you try to figure out You try to breath me, but you can't blow me out You try to feel me, but I'm so out of touch I wont be falling, you won't have to pick me up  Sorry if I sound confused, I don't feel the way you do But I won't turn around, but I won't turn around  Think that I might back down, but I won't Think that I might have doubts, but I don't No insecurities Won't you just let me, let me be? Think that you know me now, but you don't Think that I can't stand on my own Ain't my philosophy Won't you just let me, let me be?  Trust in my instincts, trust that I know what's right These are the reasons that keep you up at night (At night)
People can take everything away from you But they can never take away your truth But the question is Can you handle mine?  They say I'm crazy I really don't care That's my prerogative They say I'm nasty But I don't give a damn Getting boys is how I live Some ask me questions Why am I so real? But they don't understand me I really don't know the deal about my sister Trying hard to make it right Not long ago, before I won this fight  Everybody's talking all this stuff about me Why don't they just let me live? (tell me why)
Baby, can't you see I'm calling? A guy like you should wear a warning It's dangerous, I'm falling  There's no escape, I can't wait I need a hit, baby, give me it You're dangerous, I'm loving it  Too high, can't come down Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round Do you feel me now?  With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under With a taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic? And I love what you do
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  I think I did it again I made you believe we're more than just friends Oh baby It might seem like a crush But it doesn't mean that I'm serious 'Cause to lose all my senses That is just so typically me Oh baby, baby  Oops, I did it again I played with your heart, got lost in the game Oh baby, baby Oops, you think I'm in love That I'm sent from above I'm not that innocent
Crazy Oh, oh  Baby, I'm so into you You got that somethin', what can I do? Baby, you spin me around The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground  Every time you look at me My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see  You Drive Me Crazy, I just can't sleep I'm so excited, I'm in too deep Whoa, Crazy, but it feels alright Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night  Tell me, you're so into me
This is a story about a girl named Lucky  Early morning, she wakes up Knock, knock, knock on the door It's time for makeup, perfect smile It's you they're all waiting for  They go "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?" And they say  She's so lucky, she's a star But she cry-cry-cries in her lonely heart, thinking If there's nothing missing in my life Then why do these tears come at night? 
Oh, my love Oh, yeah Oh, yeah  I'm sitting here alone up in my room And think about the times that we've been through Oh, my love I'm looking at a picture in my hand Trying my best to understand I really wanna know what we did wrong With a love that felt so strong  If only you were here tonight I know that we could make it right  I don't know how to live without your love I was born to make you happy 'Cause you're the only one within my heart I was born to make you happy Always and forever you and me That's the way our life should be I don't know how to live without your love I was born to make you happy  I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
Do you feel this? I know you feel this Are you ready? I don't think so  Somebody give me my truck So I can ride on the clouds So I can turn up the bass like Somebody pass my guitar So I can look like a star And spend that cash like  What you gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo? Why you standing on the wall? Music starting everywhere So why don't you just move along?  I see you looking at me Like I'm some kind of freak Get up out of your seat Why don't you do somethin'? I see you looking at me Like I got what you need Get up out of your seat Why don't you do somethin'?  Now you all in my grill
Ooh hey, yeah  Hush, just stop There's nothing you can do or say, baby I've had enough I'm not your property as from today, baby You might think that I won't make it on my own  But now I'm stronger than yesterday Now it's nothing but my way My loneliness ain't killing me no more I, I'm stronger  Than I ever thought that I could be, baby I used to go with the flow
Everything Must Change  I was never one to back out of an argument and say I was wrong, Even when I'd seen the other side I'd hide my foolishness and carry on But still I'd be embarrassed 'Cos they'd see what happened and they's play along Until I back myself into a corner I would only realise when they had gone  And like a dream, a life, a reason, Everything must change (Everything, Everything Must Change) And like a world, this earth and seasons Everything must change (Everything, Everything Must Change)  In the same way when we disagree I woudn't be the one to back down Still I'd know that you had faith in me
Since you've been gone I shut my eyes and I fantasize That you're here with me Will you ever return  I won't be you satisfied 'Til you're by my side Don't wait any longer Why don't you come back  Please hurry, why don't you come back Please hurry Come back and stay for good this time Come back and stay for good this time You said goodbye  I was trying to hide what I felt inside
Fear nobody but His Majesty My spirit, you retrieved For you I wait silently It seems that you believe in me  Fear nobody but His Majesty My spirit, you retrieved For you, I wait silently It seems that you believe in me  Indestructible diggin' through the rubble Bubblin' we don't need no more trouble That bahella-scope vision, hot, hot fiction Like I'm runnin' a muck upon a rhythm  Stay on the plan so you don't lose the vision Stay sizzling Peter Pan, I'm from a land hip like this From the city feelin' it, ya, breathin' in Ya put on your glasses and ya see through it  Fear nobody but His Majesty (Fear no one) My spirit, you retrieved For you I wait silently (His majesty) It seems that you believe in me  Fear nobody but His Majesty (Fear no one) My spirit, you retrieved For you I wait silently (His majesty) It seems that you believe in me 
Mist rising on the horizon Listenin' with my ears and listenin' with my eyes and Listenin' until we've ridden the mud from the parasite Listenin' until our hearts start to glisten, realize Share the vision and my rhythms and we'll melt the ice Start sizzlin', spilling from the ceiling, bread dripping drizzling Close to the broken-heart, them crushed in spirit Redeem the soul of your servant Seek his, pursue it Keep the sparkle in your eyes Oh you know, we're not gon die
We're gonna wake this city tonight Oh, watch it burn into the twilight I said hey, hey, hey this is our birthright To be bought and sold, shipped off ready to die, we're ready to fight  We're going bom bom bom Bom bom away bom bom bom bom bom We go bom bom, bom bom away bom Bom bom, bom bom  I can't drink or drive a tank at nineteen So I set off to join the U.S. Army The first time I left my country I felt the desert sand marchin' under my feet, come march with me 
Hey how long I've been waitin' for a love so tender Hey hey hey how long can I stay without your touch I wonder You you you you tell me you can ever know oh loneliness Hey my love no no don't leave me on my own please Call me call me
Your invasion was a crime Your (see through) righteous explanations lies Kicking in our doors, raids at night Won't win our heart, you've lost your minds Your killing of my family Did not make a fan out of me If this is what your freedom reaps Keep it for your united states I'd tell you all these things but I can't speak because...  I'm dead, I'm dead My life is life no more
The memo says We gotta work to make the facts fit the false charges Pull the wool over the eyes of the filthy masses Stab the people in the back for the corporate choice Roll the propaganda out using The People's Voice We don't want to talk about it...  The press scribble scribble every half-truth spoke Then shoot it round the country like an April Fool's joke Hype the nation for a Desert Storm love affair Wave the stars and stripes like you just don't care!  They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night They talk until their face turns blue (Red white and blue!) But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day We find the picture still askew  They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it They wanna tiptoe, walk around it Wave the flag and mindlessly salute They don't want to talk about it They wanna tiptoe, walk around it Wave the flag and cowardly salute
Seems every station on the TV Is selling something no one can be If every page was torn from the magazine Would cash still drive the media machine? The products, damage and pursuit are endless Identity can leave you selfless  We will not witness this anymore  This is the end for you, my friend I can't forgive, I won't forget On and on, we sing our songs and On and on, the wars wage on and On and on, we sing our songs for more 
How can I convince you What you see is real Who am I to blame you For doubting what you feel  I was always reachin' You were just a girl I knew I took for granted The friend I have in you  I was living for a dream Loving for a moment Taking on the world That was just my style  Now I look into your eyes I can see forever The search is over You were with me all the while  Can we last forever
From the moment that we met I knew that we would connect Your eyes had told me that some how We shared your history Didnt realise i took a chance Couldnt let the moment past I felt that fate had played a hand And brought you heard to me And happiness can be short lived (can be short lived) And pain can bring you to your knees Dont think that i'll get over you Dont know if i can make it through my darkest days Without you in my life And i Dont think That i can face the pain And never see your face again (i close my eyes and wonder when)
Keeping my eyes on the road I see you, Keeping my hands on the wheel I hold you, Ninety-nine miles from L.A. I kiss you, I miss you, Please be there.  Passing a white sandy beach we're sailing,
Do you hear what I hear? (Hear what I hear, hear what I hear?) Said the night wind to the little lamb Do you see what I see? (do you see what I see?) Way up in the sky, little lamb Do you see what I see? (do you see what I see?) A star, a star, dancing in the night With a tail as big as a kite With a tail as big as a kite Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Ah-ha-ha, yeah Summer breeze, all in my mind Ah-ha, yeah Summer breeze, all in my mind No-no-no-no, it's all in my mind No-no-no-no, it's all in my mind  Summer breeze makes me feel fine Blowing through the jasmine in my mind (Oh, summer breeze) Summer breeze makes me feel fine Blowing through the jasmine in my mind, all in my mind  See the curtains hanging in the window
Ohh, yea Can you imagine us makin' love? The way it feel the first time that we touch Can you think of it the way I dream of it I want you to see it like I'm seein' it It's a picture of perfection The vision of you and I  Your lips upon my lips Can you just picture this? Your fingertips on my fingertips Your skin upon my skin Would be the sweetest sin That would be the sweetest sin Yea  All night I lay awake 'Cause it's too much to take Dreamin' about the love that we can make All day I think of schemes
Watchin' every motion In this foolish lovers game On this endless ocean Finally lovers know no shame Turnin' and returnin' To some secret place inside Watchin' in slow motion As you turn around and say My love  Take my breath away Take my breath away  Watchin' I keep waiting
The real me is a southern girl With her Levi's on and an open heart Wish I could save the world Like I was Supergirl The real me used to laugh all night Lyin in the grass just talkin' bout love But lately I've been jaded Life got so complicated  I start thinkin' about it I almost forgot what it was like To know what it feels like  But with you I can let my hair down I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me Right before I hit the ground With nothin' but a t-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you (With you, with you, with you) 
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it? If you look around The whole world is coming together now, yeah Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?  Feel it in the air The wind is taking it everywhere, yeah Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?  All the colors of the world should be Lovin' each other wholeheartedly Yes, it's alright  Take my message to your brother and tell him twice Spread the word and try to teach the man Who is hating his brother, when hate won't do ooh  'Cause we're all the same
He drives a truck And he makes Time On Your Side The water splashes from his flaps for miles And 3 am on the I5 in the dark As he moves away  Not much to do When you've got Time On Your Side
There's the moon asking to stay Long enough for the clouds to fly me away Oh, it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die  My fading voice sings of love But she cries to the clicking of time Of time  Wait in the fire Wait in the fire  Wait in the fire Wait in the fire Fire
Gazing through the window at the world outside Wondering will mother earth survive Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her Sometime  After all, there's only just the two of us And here we are, still fighting for our lives Watching all of history repeat itself Time after time  I'm just a dreamer I dream my life away I'm just a dreamer Who dreams of better days  I watch the sun go down like everyone of us I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
Don't know where you are How near or how far Willing to go It's time for the show  You learn your part, favorite part It's when you're my lover  Don't know where to go Production is slow Have life as a star Contained in a jar  If I lay my head down on your knee Pretend I'm your lover  So many things I want you to think Think about me The things you don't see Things we take away  Baby, look at my face No one can lie like a lover  If I turn away Baby, look at my face No one can lie like a lover  All of my life It's all in my guy, yeah
There are places I'll remember All my life, though some have changed Some forever not for better Some have gone and some remain  All these places have their moments With lovers and friends I still can recall Some are dead and some are living
I'm waitin' on the sun to set 'Cause yesterday ain't over yet I started smoking cigarettes There's nothing else to do I guess  Dusty roads ain't made for walking Spinning tires ain't made for stoppin' I'm giving up on love 'cause love's given up on me  I gave it everything I had And everything I got was bad Life ain't hard but it's too long
I can only imagine What it will be like When I walk by your side I can only imagine What my eyes would see When your face is before me I can only imagine I can only imagine, yeah  Surrounded by your glory What will my heart feel Will I dance for you Jesus Or in awe of You be still Will I stand in your presence To my knees will I fall Will I sing hallelujah Will I be able to speak at all I can only imagine I can only imagine 
I bet this road will take me out of here Take me far away from Amarillo I bet this car will go real fast The wheels might even drive me past The places that you said I'd never go, oh  Texas sky is the biggest one I've seen But it still ain't big enough for you and me All the things that make you mad And all the baggage in your past Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be So I'll fill her up with hope and worn out dreams  And I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west Pack the good and leave the rest
Me and Charlie boy used to go walking Sittin' in the woods behind my house When being lovers meant a stolen kiss And holding hands with nobody else around  Charlie said, "He wanted to get married " But we were only ten so we'd have to wait He said, "We'd never let our love run dry Like so many do these days"  So we treat our love like a firefly Like it only gets to shine for a little while Catch it in a mason jar with holes in the top And run like hell to show it off  Oh promises we made when we go walkin'
I used to dream that I'd discover The perfect lover someday I knew I'd recognize him If ever he came 'round my way I always used to fancy then He'd be one of those god-like kind of men With a giant brain and a noble head Like the heroes bold in the books I read  But along came Bill Who's not the type at all You'ld meet him on the street and never notice him
Midnight Lock all the doors And turn out the lights Feels like the end of the world This Sunday night  There's not a sound Outside the snow's coming down And somehow I can't seem to find
Woah, let me tell you girl Woah oh Hey, here I go, here I go  I know you heard men say it Time and time again That they would rock your world And change your life But I can't blame them Cause you make a nigga wanna get involved Wanna get the drawers Well I'm gone put my bid in And get at you No disrespect but I want it bad as they do The only difference is They look out for themselves But I'm doing it just to hear you yell, yeah  Oh That's gonna be the sound Girl when it's going down Your body saying Oh Don't have to say my name Girl I'm just glad you came So you can say Oh, In the morning Oh, In the night You saying Oh means I was hitting it right Oh, oh, oh You can't be mad at me I'm just aiming to please Let me hear you scream Oh  Girl come on over and Let's get this thing cracking You'll be surprised when You see what O's I'm packing
No, I can't forget this evening Or your face as you were leaving But I guess that's just the way the story goes You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows Yes, it shows  No, I can't forget tomorrow When I think of all my sorrow When I had you there, but then I let you go And now it's only fair that I should let you know What you should know  I can't live If living is without you
If you're lonely And need a friend And troubles seem like They never end Just remember To keep the faith And love will be there To light the way  Anytime you need a friend I will be here You'll never be alone again So don't you fear Even if you're miles away I'm by your side So don't you ever be lonely Love will make it alright  When the shadows, are closing in And your spirit, diminishing Just remember, you're not alone And love will be there To guide you home, oh  Anytime you need a friend
You were right You came over me What'd never been before You slid under my door, and now I find A Reason to admit I've been too lazy  But in this light In this atmosphere I'm starting to believe The other side of me but who's to know Honey... surely one of us is crazy  (Maybe I) Maybe I... I'm not so easily stung (Maybe I) Maybe I... I got some love for someone (Maybe I) Maybe I... I'm not the story for you
Treated me kind Sweet destiny Carried me through desperation To the one that was waitin' for me  You took so long Still I believed Somehow the one that I needed Would find me eventually  I had a vision of love And it was all that you've given to me  Prayed through the nights Felt so alone Suffered from alienation Carried the weight on my own  Had to be strong
You and I must make a pact We must bring salvation back Where there is love, I'll be there  I'll reach out my hand to you I'll have faith in all you do Just call my name and I'll be there  I'll be there to comfort you Build my world of dreams around you I'm so glad that I found you I'll be there with a love that's strong I'll be your strength You know I'll keep holdin' on 
There's a hero If you look inside your heart You don't have to be afraid Of what you are There's an answer If you reach into your soul And the sorrow that you know Will melt away  And then a hero comes along With the strength to carry on And you cast your fears aside And you know you can survive So when you feel like hope is gone Look inside you and be strong And you'll finally see the truth That a hero lies in you 
Oh, when you walk by every night Talking sweet and looking fine I get kinda hectic inside Mmm, baby I'm so into you Darling, if you only knew All the things that flow through my mind  But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby When I close my eyes You come and you take me It's so deep in my daydreams But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby  Images of rapture Creep into me slowly As you're go into my head And my heart beats faster When you take me over
Do do doop dum Do do doop do doop da dum Do do doop dum Do do doop do doop da dum Do do doop do do do Do do doop do doop da dum Do do doop dum Do do doop do doop da dum  We were as one, babe For a moment in time And it seemed everlasting That you would always be mine Now you want to be free So I'm lettin' you fly 'Cause I know in my heart babe Our love will never die  No you'll always be a part of me I'm part of you indefinitely Boy don't you know you can't escape me Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby And we'll linger on Time can't erase a feelin' this strong No way you're never gonna shake me Oh darlin' cause you'll always be my baby  Do do doop Do do doop do doop da dum
I'm thinking of you In my sleepless solitude tonight If it's wrong to love you Then my heart just won't let me be right 'Cause I've drowned in you and I won't pull through Without you by my side  I'd give my all to have Just one more night with you I'd risk my life to feel Your body next to mine 'Cause I can't go on Livin' in the memory of our song
You look in my eyes and I get emotional, inside I know it's crazy but, you still can touch my heart And after all this time., you think that I, wouldn't feel the same But time melts into nothing and nothing's changed  I still believe Someday you and me will find ourselves in love again I had a dream Someday you and me will find ourselves In love again  Each day of my life, I'm filled with all the joy I could find You know that I, I'm not the desperate type
Can you see me switchin on?  Could you push your button? Could you feel that switch? Could you push your button, Like you rub an itch? Can you find that button? Can you find that switch? Can you keep on pressing, When you hear the click?  Can you see me comin' on? (See me switchin', see me switchin')
I was born in the heart of Dublin To a holy book full of rules Made get on our knees every Sunday With the other fools  We were warped by the Christian Brothers In the cell blocks at our schools Get a hand print on your skin From a glove of jewels  Go hit me now That I'm twice your size We brushed off the accusations Bowed before your lies  This is the city that raised me With the religion they gave me Now I'm old enough to know my own mind But it was leaving that saved me
I was talking last night To a friend who was thinking he might Risk it all for a moment of lust And adventure, so I told him  You can live everyday like your last Pay the price and the moment will pass It's too late and there's no second chance If it's over, you got nothing  Well, I've been there The grass was just fine on this side Because I've been there There's no getting back on that ride
It seems like only yesterday I held you in my arms and said You will never need to fear the dark  But unforeseen misery has come Between your Mummy and me We can love you more, now we're apart  Daddy, he's got to go away 'Cos there's just no other way To live this through  Someday you'll learn to understand This wasn't what I planned For me and you
Have you ever been lost in a different world? Where everything you once knew is gone And you find yourself powerless With everything that exists, you're numb  Will I ever break free?  I search my world but I can't find you You're standing there but I can't touch you Try to talk but the words are just not there  I can feel a sense of danger You stare at me like I'm a stranger Paralyzed and you don't seem to care The demons in my dreams
Mmm, uh, mmm, yeah Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah Mmm, uh, mmm-mmm, yeah Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah  Baby I just don't get it, do you enjoy being hurt? I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt You don't believe his stories, you know that they're all lies Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why  If I was ya man, baby you'd Never worry 'bout, what I do I'd be coming home, back to you Every night, doin' you right You're the type of woman, deserves good things Fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings Baby, you're a star I just want to show you, you are  You should let me love you Let me be the one to Give you everything you want and need Baby, good love and protection Make me your selection Show you the way love's supposed to be Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you, love you, yeah Listen
[G] Listen poor sinner; you're driftin' away >From the Dear Saviour; who's pleading to- [D] Day [G]
It's funny how it tears me apart Well, first it breaks your head then your heart I should've loved you better From the start  It's chewin' at my bones and my brains It's workin' through the flesh that remains Why can't this feelin' leave me And just fade away?  From day one, I led you on
Here I go again, whether I win or lose Whether I win or lose  Another day another dollar it's about gettin' money Then you can give me a holla, my nose runny I've been out in the cold, hustlin' for so long My hands numb, but bet I feel that paper in my palm It's like ahh shit it's on, time to go shoppin' For cars not fashion, my whips be the bomb My clothes, be the same shit that we had on And fuck lookin' cute, save that for the broad  It's the H A V O, C-dump-and-reload Knock knock, answer that, I'm blastin' through the peephole Body charges, pay lawyers so we beat those But get locked and I'm sluttin' lady C.O.'s And we the only niggaz you know, that fuck they P.O.'s They push our files to the top, you still on parole We got, money to roll, no time for penitentiaries
